**List of statements what inclusion education means for me
**
    • Inclusive education means that all students attend and are welcomed by their neighborhood schools in age-appropriate, regular classes and are supported to learn, contribute and participate in all aspects of the life of the school.
    • Inclusive education is about how we develop and design our schools, classrooms, programs and activities so that all students learn and participate together.
    • Inclusive education is about ensuring access to quality education for all students by effectively meeting their diverse needs in a way that is responsive, accepting, respectful and supportive. Students participate in the education program in a common learning environment with support to diminish and remove barriers and obstacles that may lead to exclusion.
    • Enable each student to fully participate in the learning environment that is designed for all students and is shared with peers in the chosen educational setting;
    • Provide a positive climate, promote a sense of belonging and ensure student progress toward appropriate personal, social, emotional and academic goals;
    • Are responsive to individual learning needs by providing sufficient levels of support and applying student-centred teaching practices and principles.
    • Common learning environment: an inclusive environment where instruction is designed to be delivered to students of mixed ability and with their peer group in the community school, while being responsive to their individual needs as a learner, and used for the majority of the students’ regular instruction hours.
